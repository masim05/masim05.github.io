Once there is a working playbook in place (check my previous
[post](/crypto/2024/06/02/ansible-for-0g.html)), it is pretty easy to craft
the next one. This time, I created a pretty simple playbook which installs,
syncs and runs galactica validating node. The code itself and instruction is
in my git [repo](https://github.com/masim05/web3-ansible-playbooks).

Feel free to add more playbooks and send PRs, you are welcome!
